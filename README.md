# High Frequency Component Helps Explain the Generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks 
**[H. Wang, X. Wu, Z. Huang, and E. P. Xing. "High frequency component helps explain the generalization of convolutional neural networks." CVPR 2020 (Oral).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13545)**

## Highlights
|Fig. 1: The central hypothesis of our paper: within a data collection, there are correlations between the highfrequency components and the “semantic” component of the images. As a result, the model will perceive both high-frequency components as well as the “semantic” ones, leading to generalization behaviors counterintuitive to human (e.g., adversarial examples).|<img src="main.png" alt="main hypothesis of the paper" width="1600" height="whatever">

**Fig. 2: Eight testing samples selected from CIFAR10 that help explain that CNN can capture the high-frequency image: the model (ResNet18) correctly predicts the original image (1st column in each panel) and the high frequency reconstructed image (3rd column in each panel), but incorrectly predict the low-frequency reconstructed image (2nd column in each panel). The prediction confidences are also shown. Details are in the paper.**

## Before using the code

- Install the main dependency: TensorFlow 1.x and [Foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox)
- Read the main script. We recommend users to skim through the script befoure usage. We use "todo" to highlight the parts that may require attention. 
- Generate data: one can generate the data with [utility/frequencyHelper.py](https://github.com/HaohanWang/HFC/blob/master/utility/frequencyHelper.py)

## PyTorch Implementation

The results were generated by the TensorFlow code as shared here, but for the friends who prefer PyTorch, Xindi has nicely created some codes to help you start: [PyTorch Implementation](https://github.com/HaohanWang/HFC/blob/master/pytorch_implementation.zip)
